A set of sentences is given, each of which has a "cat theme" in one of three senses:

     cats (animals)
     UNIX utility cat to display file contents
     versions of the OS X operating system named after the feline family

the task is to find two sentences that are closest in meaning to the one located in the very first line. We will use cosine distance as a measure of proximity.
